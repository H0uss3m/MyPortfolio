    "bio": "Hi there! I am Houssem! Iâ€™am a self taught developer. Iâ€™ve been coding for 3 years now. Basically am a physicist ! Yeap a physicist donâ€™t be surprised i have a bachelor of Science in Physics (BPhys) degree and coding was my passion since I was in high school. So after my graduation, i decide to invest in my free time and fulfill my dream so my story of passion to the coding and programming began. I started from zero and I worked  8 hours and plus per day for 18 months to learn fundamentals and increase my skills. After that Iâ€™ve take a Full stack JS (MERN Stack) software development training at GOMYCODE Academy, since that Iâ€™ve became a developer and succeeded in my professional reorientation. Along the journey I realized that everything can be achieved by passion and hard work. In 2019, i had my first job as a front end developer, since then iâ€™ve been working on a very interesting projects along side freelance projects too.",
